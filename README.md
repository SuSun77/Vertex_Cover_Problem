# Vertex_Cover_Problem
The project is to help the local police department with their installation of security cameras at traffic intersections.\
By solving a optimization problem, called the Vertex Cover problem, allows the police to be able to minimize the number of cameras they need to install, and still be as effective as possible with their monitoring.
